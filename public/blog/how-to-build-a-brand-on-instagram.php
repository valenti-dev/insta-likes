                But, that doesn’t mean we have to forget about the basics. When building a brand on Instagram, here are the <b>important things</b> you should do:
            </p>
            <h3>Have a Clear, Distinctive Profile</h3>
            <p>
                If you’re building an effective brand on Instagram, it’s very important to have a clear profile. This is so that your brand has its own distinct tone and vibe. This can also attract more of your target audience.
            </p>
            <img src="/img/articles_sect/how-to-build-a-brand-on-instagram/3.png" alt="Artsypatee">
            <p>
                In order to have a clear profile, you need to remember the three important factors:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>A visually-appealing profile photo</b></li>
                <li><b>Interesting Instagram story highlights</b></li>
                <li><b>An easy-to-read profile bio</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Instagram is a very visualized platform. So, these are the first three things that a visitor will notice when they stumble upon your page. Therefore it’s best to make it visually appealing whilst making everything cohesive.
            </p>
            <h3>Post Effective Content</h3>
            <p>
                A good marketing strategy should be developed when <b>building a brand on Instagram</b>. Compared to a personal ig account where you can post whatever you want whenever you want, it’s important to take note of the suggested times on when to post since those are usually when most users are active and can <a href="https://likewave.io/buy-instagram-likes">like</a> or <a href="https://likewave.io/buy-instagram-followers">follower</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember to be consistent with the posts so that your brand won’t be forgotten. The often you post, the more people will remember and recognize your brand.
            </p>
            <p>
                Create interesting and intriguing posts that not only your target audience will find appealing. A good Instagram post consists of visually appealing photos and texts that will make you want to engage.
            </p>
            <img src="/img/articles_sect/how-to-build-a-brand-on-instagram/4.png" alt="Relationship with Influencers">
            <h3>Create Relationship with Influencers</h3>
            <p>
                When building a brand on Instagram, you also want to establish relationships with influencers. This type of marketing is actually cost-effective hence why many companies are choosing this strategy rather than traditional advertising.
            </p>
            <p>
                These <b>influencers</b> will help your brand grow by promoting it to their own audience who haven’t heard of your brand yet.
            </p>
            <h3>Providing Engaging Interaction with The Audience</h3>
            <p>
                Besides influencers, you should also interact with your customers, the people who are commenting under your posts. When you engage with them, they feel special and develop a personal relationship with your brand.
            </p>
            <img src="/img/articles_sect/how-to-build-a-brand-on-instagram/5.png" alt="what your audience wants?">
            <p>
                This also gives them the impression that your brand actually listens to the customers and isn’t in it for the money.
            </p>
            <h3>Choose the Right Aesthetic for Your Brand</h3>
            <p>
                As stated previously, Instagram is a unique social media platform because it heavily relies on appealing visuals. People enjoy seeing styles, patterns, and the like.
            </p>
            <p>
                Establishing a set pattern or style on your brand’s Instagram account and basically making the entire Instagram feed visually appealing will attract people into scrolling more and clicking on the posts one by one.
            </p>
            <p>
                Developing a tone is crucial when building a brand on Instagram. Create a <b>specific color</b> kit for your brand and avoid using colors that aren’t part of that kit so that it doesn’t clash with the other posts.
            </p>
            <img src="/img/articles_sect/how-to-build-a-brand-on-instagram/6.png" alt="hashtags for Instagram?">
            <h3>Using Hashtags Related to Your Brand</h3>
            <p>
                Building a brand on Instagram also means taking note of the hashtags you include in your posts. <b>Hashtags</b> place your post in search results, making anyone who clicks on that hashtag have direct access to your post.
            </p>
            <p>
                The more hashtags you add to your post, the more potential exposure it gets. Although some users don’t enjoy the sight of seeing too much hashtags, so a tip is to paste the hashtags in the comments section so that it won’t be noticed immediately by the viewer.
            </p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Instagram is a powerful social media website, it’s going to take more effort than usual for an account to stand out and be called “unique.”
